# project-two-sudoku-solver

The 2nd project i worked on. I followed no tutorial to make this, but it was based on the tic tac toe tutorial.

This game will help you solve a sudoku puzzle by showing you all the possible numbers in a given space.

To start you need to fill in the given answers and then lock them in. you need to double a space to enter in a digit. It will show the previous entered number but can be changed. Use soft reset to fix any mistakes. Will erase any numbers entered that have not been locked in.

Future plans:
	Remove typing in a number and adding in a keypad
	Using this project to learn how to import to an IOS device.
